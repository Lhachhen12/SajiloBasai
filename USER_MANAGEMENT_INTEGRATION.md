# User Management API Integration - SajiloBasai Admin Portal

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration of the User Management API throughout the SajiloBasai admin portal. The integration includes complete CRUD operations, real-time status updates, and enhanced user interface components.

## Backend API Endpoints

### User Management Routes (Admin Only)

- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/admin/users/:id` - Get user details with related data
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new user (via registration endpoint)
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id` - Update user details
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/status` - Update user status
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Delete user (with validation)

### API Features

- Pagination support (page, limit parameters)
- Search functionality (name, email)
- Role-based filtering (buyer, seller, admin)
- Status-based filtering (active, inactive, blocked, suspended)
- Data validation and error handling
- Relationship checks before deletion

## Frontend Integration

- Filter by status (active, inactive, blocked, suspended)
- Pagination with customizable page sizes

### 3. Real-time Status Management

## Database Schema

### User Model Fields

```javascript
{
  name: String (required),
  email: String (required, unique),
  password: String (required, hashed),
  role: Enum ['buyer', 'seller', 'admin'],
  status: Enum ['active', 'inactive', 'suspended', 'blocked'],
  profile: {
    avatar: String,
    phone: String,
    address: Object,
    // ... other profile fields
  },
  verification: {
    isEmailVerified: Boolean,
    isPhoneVerified: Boolean,
    // ... verification fields
  },
  lastLogin: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All admin routes require valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin only)
3. **Data Sanitization**: Input validation on both frontend and backend
4. **Relationship Integrity**: Prevents deletion of users with active data
5. **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed and excluded from responses

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New User

```javascript
const newUser = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'securepassword',
  role: 'buyer',
  phone: '+977-9841234567',
};

const result = await addUser(newUser);
```

### Updating User Status

```javascript
await updateUserStatus(userId, 'suspended');
```

### Fetching Users with Filters

```javascript
const result = await fetchUsers(1, 10, 'john', 'buyer', 'active');
```

## Error Handling

- Network errors with fallback data
- Validation errors with clear messages
- Permission errors with proper notifications
- Loading states during operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Select and manage multiple users
2. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking and reports
3. **Email Notifications**: Send notifications for status changes
4. **Profile Management**: Enhanced profile editing capabilities
5. **Activity Logs**: Track admin actions on user accounts

## Testing

The integration has been designed with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. Mock data is provided when API endpoints are unavailable, ensuring the interface remains functional during development and testing phases.

## Conclusion

The User Management API integration provides a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly solution for managing platform users. The implementation follows best practices for both frontend and backend development, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
